\section{Introduction}

In contrast for “normal” programming languages, which are designed and used with the hope to be productive and helpful, esoteric programming languages serve other goals:

They can be proof-of-concepts

They might be an art form

Or the might be designed as a kind of sport, a challenge for the language designer.

There are joke languages designed to enjoy the authors themselves, the users, or even the readers of the specification.

The term was coined by xxx in 1960. The term “esoteric” stems from xxx.

For this paper, I picked four well-known esoteric programming languages, that each demonstrate a unique property commonly found in other esoteric languages:

\textbf{Brainfuck} attempts to have a \textit{minimal} syntax, which consists only of eight different characters. Nevertheless, it can be shown to be Turing-complete. The author(s) of \textbf{INTERCAL} attempted to create a \textit{weird} language, that differed from other languages known at that time in as many aspects as possible. \textbf{Befunge} is a \textit{two-dimensional} lanuguage, the user can use directional commands to control the program flow. Finally, \textbf{Malbolge} was designed to be as hard as possible to use, it took two years to write the first program.

For each language, I'm going to describe it's origins, history, and nowadays significance, explain how the language works, give an interesting example and mention some popular variants.
